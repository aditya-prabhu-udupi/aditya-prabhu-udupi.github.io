# Portfolio Website

This project is a simple portfolio website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of this project was to create a personal online space where I can showcase my skills, resume, and contact information. 

While I initially used code that was sourced from [Rishabh Mishra](https://github.com/rishabhnmishra), I learned a lot through the process of customizing and understanding how the different components work together. This project served as a great introduction to web development, helping me to get a deeper understanding of frontend technologies.

# Features

The website includes the following sections:

- **Home**: This is the landing page of the portfolio. It gives visitors a brief introduction about me and includes an engaging, user-friendly interface.

- **About**: In this section, I provide more detailed information about my skills, background, and interests. It helps visitors get to know me better.

- **Resume**: This section is a showcase of my qualifications, including my education and Internships.

- **Contact**: Here, visitors can find various ways to reach out to me. The contact section includes Address, Contact number, Email address and resume download.

## Technologies Used

## Learning Outcome

Though the initial code was borrowed from a source, I learned a great deal about building a responsive website and adapting the design to fit my personal brand. This project was an important step in my journey to becoming proficient in web development, and I‚Äôm excited to continue working on and improving this portfolio in the future.
